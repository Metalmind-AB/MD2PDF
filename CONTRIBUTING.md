- Relevant logs or error messages
- Sample files that reproduce the issue (if applicable)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Detailed description of the proposed feature
- Use cases and examples
- Potential implementation approach (if you have ideas)
- Any relevant mockups or diagrams

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` - Simple issues for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Issues where we need community help
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### Pull Requests

1. **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/add-latex-support` or `fix/unicode-handling`

2. **Commits**: 
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Use conventional commits format when possible: `type(scope): description`
   - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

3. **Code changes**:
   - Include tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Follow the style guidelines

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting**:
   ```bash
   # Format code
   black src/ tests/
   isort src/ tests/
   
   # Run linters
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   bandit -r src/
   
   # Run tests

   ```

2. **PR Description**:
   - Reference any related issues
   - Describe what changes you've made
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - List any breaking changes

3. **Review process**:
   - PRs require at least one review before merging

4. **After merge**:
   - Delete your feature branch
   - Pull the latest changes to your local main branch

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting with:
- Line length: 88 characters
- Python 3.8+ syntax

### Code Organization

- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Documentation Style

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep language clear and concise
- Update the README for user-facing changes

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=md2pdf --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_converter.py

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_style"
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source code structure
- Use descriptive test names
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Use fixtures for common test data

Example test:

```python
def test_pdf_conversion_with_custom_style(tmp_path):
    """Test PDF conversion with a custom style."""
    # Arrange
    input_file = tmp_path / "test.md"
    input_file.write_text("# Test Document")
    
    # Act
    converter = MD2PDFConverter(
        input_path=str(input_file),
        style="technical",
        theme="github"
    )
    output = converter.convert()
    
    # Assert
    assert output.exists()
    assert output.suffix == ".pdf"
```

## Documentation

### Docstring Format

We use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def convert_markdown(input_path: str, style: str = "default") -> Path:
    """Convert a Markdown file to PDF.
    
    Args:
        input_path: Path to the input Markdown file.
        style: Name of the style template to use.
    
    Returns:
        Path to the generated PDF file.
    
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the input file doesn't exist.
        ValueError: If the style is not recognized.
    """
```
